DIRECTIONS
Preheat oven to 350°. In a large bowl, toss apples, brown sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt together. 
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, salt, and cinnamon. Add melted butter and stir until dough forms. Press mixture into a 10” or 11” tart pan with a removable bottom, pressing until dough is smooth. 
Arrange apples over crust, sprinkle with granulated sugar and dot top with butter. Bake until crust is golden and apples are tender, about 1 hour. 
Brush with melted apricot preserves and let cool slightly before slicing and serving.
